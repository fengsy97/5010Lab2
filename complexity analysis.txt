 complexity analysis

1. Weighted Methods per Class:
    Attributes: 1
    Methods: 2
    Lines of code: 2
    Total Score: 5
2. Depth of Inheritance Tree:
 Score: 1
3. Number of Children:
 Score: 2 (Dog and Cat classes both inherit from Animal)
4. Coupling between Objects:
 Score: 1 (Car class is dependent on the Engine class)
5. Response for a Class:
 Score:
 Methods in the class: 2
 Method calls outside the class: 0
 Total: 4
6. Cohesion across Methods:
 This metric does not contribute to a numerical score.
 Overall Total Score: 5 (Weighted Methods per Class) + 1 (Depth of Inheritance Tree) + 2 (Number of Children) + 1 (Coupling between Objects) + 4 (Response for a Class) = 13
